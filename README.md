HDB Resale Prices in Singapore

HDB resale prices in Singapore have been on a steady incline for the past few years, with no indication of this trend changing in the near future. This has caused some concern among home buyers, as the high prices may prevent them from being able to afford a home in the city-state. Despite this, demand for HDB resale units continues to be high, as many people view property ownership as a sound investment. 

The HDB released a set of resale price guidelines for HDB resale units on 22 November 2017. Those guidelines took effect from 6 January 2018, which allowed buyers to purchase a resale flat at an average of 4.25 times the monthly income of their household, similar to the price criteria introduced in 2013. The original guidelines, introduced in 2013, allowed buyers to purchase a resale flat at an average of 3.0 times the monthly household income of the household. 

This paper seeks to explore;

The reasons behind this trend
If the trend is likely to continue
Whether a purchase of a 4-room Model A flat that is 25 years and above will still have its resale value appreciated/depreciated


Official data of the resale HDB units were sourced from: https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices

We will explore this data using Python as the language in the Jupyter Notebook.
